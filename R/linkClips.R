#' A function brought over from the SPDT package and updated to work with DataPond. Created to load, clean and standardize SLD data for SPDT analysis.
#' Function only usable by FFSBC staff who have a direct or vpn connection to SLD.
#'
#'
#' This is the second data filtering and cleaning process after SLD2R() to reduce down to biological data that can be tied to releases.
#' Takes SLD2R() data and uses mark_code information to tie fish back to stocking event, age, strain, genotype where possible.
#' Make sure your VPN is running, so that the database can be accessed by the function.
#' The Biological record count remains the same, but includes information about the potential stocking event(s) tied to each fish.
#' In cases where clips are unique, then fields for age, strain, genotype are updated if black. Otherwise a list of possibilities can be found
#' in "clipAges, clipStrains, clipGenos.
#' All other data tables only include data that can be linked to the Biological data, either same Assessment_Key, or rel_id.
#' Any data Tables you have open as Assessments, Nets, Lakes, Biological, Releases will be replaced with versions from this function.
#' Lookup tables for integer ages and strain codes are included as part of package and can by called as Ages, Strain_code_LU
#' Ultimately, as upload filters and cleaning are improved in the main database, this function will become obsolete.

#' @param Sampled_only a logical TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to reduce data tables to records associated with a sampling event with Biological data.
#' If true (default) then Assessments, Nets, Lakes and Releases tables are all reduced to Lake-years that can cross reference to Biological records.
#' @param Data_source a TRUE FALSE value to indicate whether to load data form the SLD, or just use data tables in the Environment.
