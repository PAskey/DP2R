\title{Plot precomputed gillnet selectivity curves}
\usage{
plot_selectivity(
  sel_lookup = NULL,
  species,
  design,
  classes = 75:900,
  facet = c("none", "species", "design"),
  colour_by = c("auto", "species", "design", "interaction")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sel_lookup}{A data frame like \code{sel_lookup} containing at least
\code{species_code}, \code{sample_design_code}, and a list-column \code{curve}
with numeric vectors of selectivity values.
If \code{NULL}, the function loads \code{sel_lookup} from package data.}

\item{species}{Character vector of species codes to plot (e.g., \code{c("RB","EB")}).}

\item{design}{Character vector of sample design codes to plot
(e.g., \code{c("SGN7","FWIN")}).}

\item{classes}{Integer/numeric vector of lengths (mm) corresponding to the curve
indices. Defaults to \code{75:900}. Must match the length range used when
building \code{sel_lookup}.}

\item{facet}{One of \code{"none"}, \code{"species"}, or \code{"design"} indicating
whether to facet the plot.}

\item{colour_by}{One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"species"}, \code{"design"},
or \code{"interaction"}. If \code{facet != "none"}, this argument is ignored
and colour is mapped to the non-faceted variable for consistent legend/colours.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Plot relative gillnet selectivity curves from the precomputed lookup table
\code{sel_lookup}. Curves can be compared across species within a net design,
across net designs within a species, or across multiple species and designs.
}
\details{
When faceting is used, the colour mapping is automatically forced to be
consistent across facets (e.g., if faceting by design, colours represent
species only; if faceting by species, colours represent designs only).


The lookup table \code{sel_lookup} is typically built in \code{data-raw/} using
\code{\link{predict_Millar}} and saved to the package \code{data/} directory.
This plotting function does not recompute selectivity; it only visualizes
precomputed curves.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data(sel_lookup)

# Compare species within a single net design
plot_selectivity(species = c("RB","EB"), design = "SGN7")

# Compare net designs within a single species
plot_selectivity(species = "RB", design = c("SGN7","FWIN","SWIN"))

# Facet by design, colours fixed by species
plot_selectivity(species = c("RB","EB"), design = c("SGN7","FWIN"), facet = "design")

# Facet by species, colours fixed by design
plot_selectivity(species = c("RB","EB"), design = c("SGN7","FWIN"), facet = "species")
}
