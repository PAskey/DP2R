\title{Approximate species mapping for gillnet selectivity}
\format{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{species_code}{Character. Species code observed in biological samples.}
  \item{select_spp}{Character. Species code of the selectivity model to use
    when applying gillnet selectivity.}
  \item{match_level}{Character. Taxonomic level at which the proxy species
    was matched (e.g., \code{"species_code"}, \code{"species"},
    \code{"genus"}, \code{"family"}, \code{"order"}).}
}
}
\usage{
data(approx_select_spp)
}
\description{
A lookup table mapping observed fish \code{species_code} values to the
species selectivity model actually used when applying gillnet selectivity.
}
\details{
This table is used when a species does not have a fitted selectivity model
in \code{\link{sel_lookup}}. In such cases, selectivity is approximated using
a proxy species selected from available models based on taxonomic similarity
and data availability.

The proxy species (\code{select_spp}) is chosen using the following hierarchy:
\enumerate{
  \item Exact match on \code{species_code} (if available in \code{sel_lookup})
  \item Match on taxonomic \code{species} (from the \code{Species} table)
  \item Genus
  \item Subfamily
  \item Family
  \item Order
}

When multiple candidate model species are available at the same taxonomic
level, the proxy species is selected as the one occurring most frequently
in the \code{Biological} dataset used to build the lookup table.

This table is generated internally (typically once per year) and stored
in the package \code{data/} directory. It is not intended to be edited
manually.


The \code{approx_select_spp} table is used by
\code{\link{add_selectivity}} to determine which selectivity curve to apply
for each fish record. If no proxy species can be identified, selectivity
defaults to 1 (i.e., no size-based selectivity adjustment).
